    <h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>
    <p>Important Terms & Conditions

From the “Fair Practices Code” and related RBI guidelines the following are essential:

The lender must send the borrower, in writing (via sanction letter or comparable document), the amount of loan sanctioned along with all terms & conditions — including annualised rate of interest, method of application, fees/charges, tenure, and collateral requirements. 

The application form must include information that will affect the borrower’s interest so that the borrower can meaningfully compare among lenders/product options. Also the documents required must be clearly listed. 

The language of communication (loan agreement, sanction letter) must be in English / Hindi / vernacular — or a language understood by the borrower. 

Any change in terms & conditions (interest rate, service charges, prepayment charges, disbursement schedule) must be notified to the borrower, and changes must be effected only prospectively (not retroactively). 

Lenders must release securities/collateral once all dues are paid or the loan is realised — barring legitimate claims by the lender. A borrower must be notified if any lien is retained. 

On default or non-compliance of material terms, any penalty should be in the form of penal charges (a one-time / defined charge), not “penal interest” (i.e., raising the rate of interest or compounding further interest on the penalty). 

Lenders must not discriminate on grounds of sex, caste, religion when granting loans. They must act fairly and reasonably in dealings with borrowers. 

In case the lender proposes to recall / accelerate payment / demand additional security, it must be in accordance with the loan agreement or with reasonable notice if the agreement doesn’t specify.</p>
